# Simple-Image-Slider-


This project is a basic image slider created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main purpose of building this was to practice JavaScript concepts such as:

✔️ DOM manipulation (handling elements dynamically)</br>
✔️ Event handling (click events for navigation)</br>
✔️ Loops & conditions (for managing slides)</br>
✔️ Class manipulation (applying active states to elements)</br>
